The JotUrl.com Conversion Code template will provide you with the ability to track conversions (e.g. clicks, sales, leads, sign-ups, installs, downloads, etc.) originating from clicks on branded links you share on your offsite channels (social media, chat apps, newsletters, mobile apps, press releases, articles, blogs, QR codes, etc.). 

Cre­ate con­ver­sion codes within JotUrl’s dashboard, manage them within the Google Tag Manager template and start tracking con­ver­sions, rev­enues and com­mis­sions carried on your pages, in minutes.
